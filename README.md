# Djangonautic

Djangonautic is a Django blog web application that outlines my journey of learning the framework. After learning Python in my Computer Science course I was super excited to start learning Django since I wanted to test out what I had learned in the course into something of my own to remember. It goes through what I found easy, and everything that I had trouble in as I had been using some tutorial videos that used an older version of Python and Django compared to the new improved Django coding that had upgraded over the years. Learning this framework was a lot of fun and one of the most confusing because of all the coding differences from the older version. I also played around with the Django database and made it user authenticated so no new articles can be created unless you sign up or login to the application.
