# Djangonautic

Djangonautic is a Django blog web application allows users to sign-up/sign-in to create and share blog articles. After learning Python in my Computer Science course I was super excited to start learning Django since I wanted to test out what I had learned in the course into something of my own to remember. Learning this framework was a lot of fun and one of the most confusing because of all the coding differences from the older version. I utilized the Django database and made it user authenticated so no new articles can be created unless you sign-up or login to the application.
